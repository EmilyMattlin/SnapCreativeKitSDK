# SnapCreativeKitSDK
To use this Kit, make sure to install cocoapods first and pod init and pod install. Then add the creative kit and core kit frameworks to the Embedded Binaries and Linked Frameworks and Libraries sections in the general section. Then, in info.plist, change the SCSDKClientId string to your own Client ID from your app that you submitted on https://kit.snapchat.com/portal/apps.
